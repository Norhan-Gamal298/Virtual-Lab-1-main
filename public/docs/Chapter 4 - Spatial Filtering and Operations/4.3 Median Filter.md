#### - Median Filter

The median filter is a non-linear filter that replaces each pixel‚Äôs value with the median value of its neighboring pixels. It is especially effective in removing salt-and-pepper noise from an image while preserving edges better than linear filters. This is because the median filter doesn‚Äôt average out the extreme values as much as the mean, thus maintaining sharper boundaries between different regions of an image.

The median filter works by sliding a window over the image and sorting the pixel values in the window. The median value is then assigned to the central pixel. This process is repeated for each pixel in the image.


#### üêç Python

```python
import cv2  # Import the OpenCV library for image processing
import numpy as np  # Import NumPy for numerical operations

# Read the input image in grayscale mode
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg', 0)  # Read the image

# Apply a median filter to the image
# The second argument is the size of the kernel (e.g., 5 for a 5x5 kernel)
median_filtered = cv2.medianBlur(img, 5)

# Display the original and filtered images
cv2.imshow('Original Image', img)
cv2.imshow('Median Filtered Image', median_filtered)
cv2.waitKey(0)  # Wait for a key press to close the windows
cv2.destroyAllWindows()  # Close all OpenCV windows
```

#### üß† MATLAB

```matlab
% Read the input image
img = imread('image.jpg');  % Read the image

% Apply a median filter to the image
% The second argument is the size of the neighborhood (e.g., 5 for a 5x5 neighborhood)
median_filtered = medfilt2(img, [5 5]);

% Display the original and filtered images
figure;
subplot(1, 2, 1); 
imshow(img); 
title('Original Image');

subplot(1, 2, 2); 
imshow(median_filtered); 
title('Median Filtered Image');
```
