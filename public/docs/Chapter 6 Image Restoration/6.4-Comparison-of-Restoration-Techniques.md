# 6.4 Comparison of Image Restoration Techniques

- In this section, we compare the key image restoration methods discussed previously, focusing on their performance, assumptions, and best use cases.



## Comparison Table

| Feature                  | Inverse Filtering                          | Wiener Filtering             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Noise Handling           | Poor                                       | Excellent                    |
| Blur Handling            | Good (if noise-free)                       | Good                         |
| Requires PSF             | Yes                                        | Yes                          |
| Computational Complexity | (Low)                                      | (Moderate)                   |
| Domain                   | Frequency domain (FFT)                     | Frequency domain (FFT)       |
| Mathematical Model       | \( \hat{F}(u,v) = \frac{G(u,v)}{H(u,v)} \) | See Wiener equation          |
| Best Use Case            | Pure blur without noise                    | Blur with Gaussian/S&P noise |

## Summary

- Inverse filtering is simple but fails in the presence of noise.
- Wiener filtering is more sophisticated and handles noise effectively, especially when the noise characteristics are known or estimated.
- Wiener is usually the better choice in real-world scenarios where noise is inevitable.
