- Low-Level:involve primitive operations such as image preprocessing to reduce noise, contrast enhancement, and image sharpening. A low-level process is characterized by the fact that both its inputs and outputs are images
- Mid-Level: rocessing on images involves tasks such as segmentation (partitioning an image into regions or objects), it is characterized by the fact that its inputs generally are images, but its outputs are attributes extracted from those images (e.g., edges, contours, and the identity of individual objects)
- High-Level:involves “making sense” of an ensemble of recognized objects Image understanding, interpretation
