# 1.1: What is Image Processing?

- Image Processing is a technique used to perform operations on images to improve their quality or to extract important information from them. It is a key technology in fields such as computer vision, medical imaging, remote sensing, and many more.

## Why is it Important?

- Enhances Image Quality: Helps improve the overall quality of an image, such as noise removal, contrast adjustment, and sharpening. This is especially useful in situations where images are captured under low-light conditions or have poor quality due to camera limitations.

- Feature Extraction for Computer Vision: Enables the identification and extraction of specific features from an image (such as edges, corners, and textures). This is critical for tasks like object recognition, face detection, and image classification.

  ### Used in Various Fields:

- Medical Imaging: Facilitates the analysis of medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, to identify health conditions or abnormalities.

- Satellite Imaging: Used to process images from satellites for applications such as weather forecasting, environmental monitoring, and urban planning.

- Face Recognition: Powers biometric systems for security by analyzing and recognizing facial features.

- Agriculture: Assists in analyzing aerial images of crops to monitor growth, detect diseases, and estimate yields.

- Autonomous Vehicles: Image processing is essential for the navigation systems of self-driving cars, enabling them to interpret the environment and avoid obstacles.

- Improved Decision Making: By processing and analyzing images, it becomes easier to make informed decisions in real-time, especially in fields like security, surveillance, and robotics.

- Image Compression: Reduces the size of images without significantly compromising quality, making it easier to store and transmit large amounts of visual data.

## Python Code 

``` python
# Import OpenCV for image processing
import cv2
# Import Matplotlib for displaying images
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read the image in color mode (BGR format)
img = cv2.imread('sample.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)

# Convert the color image to grayscale
gray_img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Create a figure with two subplots: one for original image, one for grayscale
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 6))
fig.tight_layout()

# Display the original image (convert from BGR to RGB for correct colors in matplotlib)
axes[0].imshow(cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
axes[0].set_title('Original Image')
axes[0].axis('off')  # Hide axes ticks

# Display the grayscale image with gray colormap
axes[1].imshow(gray_img, cmap='gray')
axes[1].set_title('Grayscale Image')
axes[1].axis('off')  # Hide axes ticks

# Show both images in the window
plt.show()

```

## Matlab Code

``` matlab

% Read the image in color (RGB)
img = imread('sample.jpg');

% Convert the color image to grayscale
gray_img = rgb2gray(img);

% Create a figure with two subplots
figure;

% Display the original image
subplot(1, 2, 1);
imshow(img);
title('Original Image');

% Display the grayscale image
subplot(1, 2, 2);
imshow(gray_img);
title('Grayscale Image');

```
