# 10.8 – Color Image Compression


## 🔍 Overview
Compression reduces image file size by eliminating redundancy. Two main types:
- **Lossless** (e.g., PNG)
- **Lossy** (e.g., JPEG)

## 📐 Compression Concept

Compression Ratio:
```
CR = Original Size / Compressed Size
```

JPEG uses Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and quantization.

## 🧪 OpenCV (Python) Example

```python
import cv2

# Read the image from the file
img = cv2.imread('color_sample.png')

# Save the image in JPEG format with compression quality set to 50%
# cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY controls the JPEG compression quality (0 to 100)
# Lower values reduce file size but lose quality
cv2.imwrite('compressed.jpg', img, [int(cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY), 50])

# Inform the user that the image has been saved with reduced quality
print("Image saved as 'compressed.jpg' with JPEG quality set to 50.")

```

## 🧪 MATLAB Example

```matlab
% Read the image
img = imread('color_sample.png');

% Save the image as a compressed JPEG with quality set to 50%
imwrite(img, 'compressed.jpg', 'jpg', 'Quality', 50);

```
