# 4.1 Sharpening Filters

- Sharpening filters are used to enhance the edges and fine details in an image by emphasizing the high-frequency components. These filters work by highlighting areas where there is a rapid change in intensity, making edges more distinct.

## 2.1 Laplacian (2nd Derivative)

- The Laplacian filter is a second-order derivative filter that highlights regions of rapid intensity change, making it useful for edge detection. It calculates the second derivative of the image and emphasizes areas where the intensity changes most rapidly. This results in a sharpened image where edges are more prominent.

- The Laplacian operator is often applied using a convolution kernel that detects the rate of change in pixel intensities. It is effective at detecting both horizontal and vertical edges in an image.

## Python Code 

```python

# Import the OpenCV library for image processing
import cv2  
# Import NumPy for numerical operations
import numpy as np  
# Import Matplotlib for plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Read the input image in color mode using the unified image name
img = cv2.imread('sample.jpg')  # Read the image

# Define the sharpening kernel (Laplacian filter)
sharpening_kernel = np.array([[0, -1, 0],
                               [-1, 5, -1],
                               [0, -1, 0]])

# Apply the sharpening filter using filter2D
sharpened_image = cv2.filter2D(img, -1, sharpening_kernel)

# Create a figure to display the original and sharpened images
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))  # Set the figure size

# Display the original image
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)  # 1 row, 2 columns, 1st subplot
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))  # Convert BGR to RGB for display
plt.title('Original Image')  # Title for the original image
plt.axis('off')  # Hide axes

# Display the sharpened image
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)  # 1 row, 2 columns, 2nd subplot
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(sharpened_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))  # Convert BGR to RGB for display
plt.title('Sharpened Image (Laplacian Filter)')  # Title for the sharpened image
plt.axis('off')  # Hide axes

# Show the combined figure
plt.tight_layout()  # Adjust layout for better spacing
plt.show()  # Display the images

```

## MATLAB Code 

```matlab

% Read the input image
img = imread('sample.jpg');

% Define the sharpening kernel (Laplacian filter)
sharpening_kernel = [0 -1 0; -1 5 -1; 0 -1 0];

% Apply the sharpening filter to each channel
sharpened_img = img;  % Initialize output
for c = 1:size(img, 3)
    sharpened_img(:, :, c) = imfilter(img(:, :, c), sharpening_kernel, 'replicate');
end

% Display the original and sharpened images
figure;

% Display original image
subplot(1, 2, 1);
imshow(img);
title('Original Image');

% Display sharpened image
subplot(1, 2, 2);
imshow(sharpened_img);
title('Sharpened Image (Laplacian Filter)');
